# Memory-Game
I created a Memory Game as a personal project to improve my skills in JavaScript and CSS.

## Features
- Randomized photos: The game presents the player with a set of photos that are placed randomly each time the game is restarted.
- Counting wrong tries: The game keeps track of the number of incorrect attempts the player makes while trying to match the photos with their respective positions.
- Finishing the game: The player's goal is to correctly guess the position of all the photos with the least number of incorrect attempts in order to successfully complete the game.
